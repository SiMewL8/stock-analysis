Stock Analysis: Helping Steve research Green Energy stocks using VBA

#Challenge

Having practiced VBA code that now runs efficiently and clean, Steve can break no sweat and access his analysis for stocks for any year.

While initially researching 2018 stock Ticker *DQ*, we found out that DQ had a decent amount of volume but a yearly return yield of -63%, which clearly indicated that Steve should not *invest* his time on this stock. Our code was long but thorough. However, in order to please Steve and reduce his newfound frustration, we wanted to refractor our code and run an efficient method that can be utilized to analyize all stocks from any year.

Hence, we updated our code so that it fits for any amount of stock, not just in the thousands, as well as any year provided that he downloads the raw data first. Now, Steve can take his time and research any stock that will be worth investing his time.
